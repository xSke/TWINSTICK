# Hello there!

This is **TWIN STICK**, a game about beating variously shaped bosses with two small (and painful) sticks. I made it in three days for the [GDL Secret Jam](http://gamedevleague.com/topic/123/intro-to-the-secret-game-jam). Of course, it's not a shining example of code quality ^(in fact, the code is fucking terrible), but eh, it gets works and I'll probably never touch it again.
